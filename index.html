        <div class="entry">
            <h2>1600s</h2>
            <p>
                The indigenous people have a history of being welcome to newcomers
                dating all the way back to the first European settlers, who traded 
                and cooperated with the indigenous peoples of pre-canada. However, 
                European countries, many of whom were imbroiled in political, military
                and social conflict saw the Indigenous people, as not allies, but people
                that could be manipulated.

            <h2>Terra Nullius</h2>
            <p>
                In a lot of European countries, doctrines like Terra Nullius and the 
                Doctrine of Discovery were drafted and written into law. These doctrines 
                stated that Turtle Island, also known as North America, was empty land, and 
                is governed by no state entity. This allowed colonial governments to claim land, 
                not based on land swpas and agreements, but based on  "Discovery".

            <h2>Treaties</h2>
            <p>
                While a lot of treaties were signed willingly by Native leaders trying to establish 
                friendly relations with the Europeans, some were put under pressure or coersed into 
                signing these agreements. While the indigenous lraders thought that the treaties were 
                to share land, the English, formalized language often included claused that involved ceding 
                land and resources. The concept of giving away land is very hard to communicate in most indigenous 
                languages, but Europeans made no effort to create proper dialogue and were at times dishonest.

            <h2>Assimilation</h2>
            <p>
                The Canadian government imposed a national policy of assimilation or "de-indianfication"
                on the Native peoples. This included stopping some indigenous groups, who had nomad lifestyles to 
                stay in contained reserved areas. The government also forced a "modernized" version of 
                government, where the indigenous people would vote for an indigenous man (women were barred from running).
                If an Indigenous woman married a white settler, the woman and any children they have will be removed of 
                thier Indian status.

            <h2>Residential Schools</h2>
            <p>
                As apart of the assimilation of the Native populus, residential schools were put into place to uproot indigenous culture. 
                The Canadian government forcably removed children from thier families and made them go to Catholic boarding schools, as a form of 
                re-education into a "civil" lifestyle. These children were often abused and mistreated by the people who were supposed to care 
                and educate them. The total death toll from these schools is still unknown today.
